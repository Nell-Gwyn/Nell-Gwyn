"Hell is the home of honor, duty, justice, and the rest of the seven deadly virtues.<br>
All the wickedness on earth is done in their name; where else but in hell should they have their reward?"<br>

<i>I should have been an actor,<br>
such talent have I got!<br>
I'm brilliant at pretending<br>
I'm someone that I'm not!<br>

When I was very small,<br>
they sent me off to school,<br>
to learn to read and write<br>
and recite the golden rule.<br>
I wasn't very clever<br>
or the least bit smart,<br>
but I acted like a scholar<br>
and I played the part!<br>

I played the part (she played the part!)<br>
to great acclaim! (to great acclaim!)<br>
I got an "A" on every paper,<br>
and I couldn't spell my name!<br>
I played the part (she played the part!)<br>
and that was it! (she did her bit!)<br>
Nobody knew I was a lazy little git (lazy git!)<br>

When I was seventeen,<br>
they sent me off to war.<br>
They stuffed me in a parachute<br>
and dropped me on the shore.<br>
I didn't know a rifle<br>
from a cherry tart,<br>
but I acted like a soldier<br>
and I played the part!<br>

I played the part (she played the part!)<br>
and gave 'em heck! (she gave 'em heck!)<br>
They put a stripe upon my elbow<br>
and a medal round my neck!<br>
I played the part (she played the part!)<br>
and that was that! (she laid 'em flat!)<br>
Nobody knew I was a scaredy little cat! (scaredy cat!)<br>
  
I played the part of the loyal housewife,<br>
whilst I kept a little cutie safely hid! (safely hid!)<br>
I played the part of the trusty employee,<br>
and I hadn't the foggiest notion what I did! (rotten kid!)<br>

When I have come to pass,<br>
they'll send me to my fates,<br>
at heaven's pearly gates,<br>
that is where St. Peter waits!<br>
I've been a sneaky devil<br>
from the very start,<br>
but I'll act like I'm an angel<br>
and I'll play the part!<br>

I'll play the part (she'll play the part)<br>
and knock 'em dead! (she'll knock 'em dead!)<br>
I'll put a harp between my knees,<br>
and a halo atop my head!<br>
I'll play the part (she'll play the part!)<br>
and do it well! (she will excel!)<br>
And I'll be sent with the other actors straight to hell! (straight to hell!)<br>
I'll be sent with the other actors straight to hell! (she'll go to hell!)</i><br>

<i>I am the very model of a Usenet individual.<br>
I've information meaningless and ultimately trivial.<br>
I know the basic elements of alien biology,<br>
and all the hidden secrets of the Church of Scientology.<br>

I've seen "The Wrath of Khan" and every Star Trek film that followed it,<br>
I moan about my Servicecard and how the cash till swallowed it.<br>
About the laws on handguns I am sending off a counterblast,<br>
with many cheerful facts about the way you can MAKE MONEY FAST!<br>

I'll tell you why the Japanese are taking over Panama<br>
and why the USA is still a better place than Canada.<br>
In short, in matters meaningless and ultimately trivial,<br>
I am the very model of a Usenet individual.<br>

I post, in alt.revisionism, lies about the Holocaust,<br>
I cut my .sig to twenty lines (I didn't want to, I was forced),<br>
I really can't believe the "Good Times" virus to be mythical,<br>
and Clinton's raising taxes, which is, frankly, bloody typical,<br>

I've upset several people on alt.flame, I really don't know how,<br>
and sent a thousand business cards to Mr. and Mrs. Shergold now.<br>
I have a very poor grip of political geography,<br>
and absolutely no involvement (yet!) in child pornography,<br>

I've paid two-fifty dollars for the Nieman-Marcus recipe,<br>
and told the Spanish tourist's tale about the toothbrush pessary.<br>
In short, in matters meaningless and ultimately trivial,<br>
I am the very model of a Usenet individual.<br>

In fact, when I know what is meant by "binary" and "FTP",<br>
when I know how to decode porno JPEGs from a .uue,<br>
when I can handle HTML, Telnet, mail and IRC,<br>
and when I know the words initialised to form "http",<br>

when I have learnt what topics are acceptable in talk.bizarre,<br>
when I know more of Usenet than the tailpipe of a motor-car,<br>
in short, when I've a smattering of elementary netiquette,<br>
you'll say a better individual has never surfed the Net.<br>

For my technical experience, although I claim to know it all,<br>
could barely serve to run the installation disk from AOL.<br>
But still, in matters meaningless and ultimately trivial,<br>
I am the very model of a Usenet individual.</i><br>
